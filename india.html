        buildings are painted in a Brahmin blue colour. Residents did this to distinguish 
        themselves as Brahmins. This isn&#8217;t the only history to be found here as it&#8217;s also 
        home to the magnificent Mehrangarh Fort. Inside one of India&#8217;s largest forts is Maharaja 
        Gaj Singh II&#8217;s personal collection of riches, and there are a lot of them, with over 15,000 
        treasures to see in total

      <h2 class="nin-sub">Histroy: Nintnedo saving the North American gaming industry</h2>
      <p>
        The Crash of 1983 is infamous for the failures of the American video game industry, 
        but not many know who revived the industry. The Golden Age did not last for long as 
        the video game industry came to a crash in 1983. The crash resulted from many failures, 
        such as an oversaturated market, lack of publishing control, and low consumer confidence 
        due to low&ndash;quality games. With the lack of Atari&#8217;s leadership in NA for video games during 
        the crash, Nintendo announced the Advanced Video Entertainment System(AVS) release. Through 
        the success of NES and the positive reputation of Nintendo, it regained the confidence of the 
        retailers and consumers, which rescued the American video game industry. Nintendo saved the American 
        Video Game Industry after the Crash by implementing efficient marketing strategies, redesigning the NES, 
        which revolutionized the industry, and introducing the 10NES lockout chip, which prevented the use of third-party 
        cartridges.

      <h2 class="nin-sub">Part I: The Marketing Campaigns</h2>
      <p>
        Nintendo Entertainment System effectively utilized the marketing campaigns to re&ndash;image their 
        product as something more than a video game console. Another way NES advertised its product 
        was through slogans, one of the famous being, "Now you&#8217;re playing with power!" There were plenty 
        of those ads aired on Tv which were popularized with movie collaborations, such as Alien and Terminator. 
        Through catchy slogans, Nintendo created a hub of recognition and engagement for video games. That is how 
        NES was successfully able to change the perception of consumers and retailers with marketing campaigns that 
        built trust and reframed the damaged North American video game industry after the crash of 1983

      <h2 class="nin-sub">Part II: Nintendo Seal and 10NES lockout chip </h2>
      <p>
        The last effective strategy used by Nintendo in the NES to boost off the North American video game 
        market after the crash of 1983 was the introduction of the Nintendo seal and 10NES lockout chip. One 
        could argue that the crash of 1983 would have been prevented if the big companies such as Atari had 
        implemented a strategy to limit third&ndash;party developers with a similar chip like 10NES. With the knowledge 
        of the recent crash due to uncontrolled third&ndash;party developers, Nintendo avoided the same fate by introducing 
        the 10NES chip and "Seal of Quality." The lockout chip worked by preventing unlicensed or pirated game cartridges 
        from running on NES. The chip was located in the cartridge and was different throughout regions. So, therefore, 
        third&ndash;party developers had to pay licensing fees to use the games; this became an excellent revenue for Nintendo.  
        Therefore the quality and quantity of the video games were finally controlled by the company itself, which improved 
        consumer confidence and satisfaction. That&#8217;s how Nintendo helped rebuild the North American gaming industry after the 
        crash through the limitation of third&ndash;party video games.

      <h2 class="nin-sub">Part III: Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Therefore Nintendo singlehandedly rebuilt the slowly disappearing North American video gaming industry after the crash with 
        the introduction of NES. NES became the best&ndash;selling gaming console after the crash because Nintendo invested tremendous resources 
        in the marketing campaigns to re&ndash;image its product as something more than a video game. NES&#8217;s revolutionary redesign included exciting 
        accessories, and lastly, they introduced a 10NES chip with a Nintendo seal that helped limit third&ndash;party games influencing the market. 
        Nintendo not only helped revive the industry, but it also set new standards with the release of NES. Those Standards would prevent a similar 
        crash from taking place in the future. Nintendo became more significant than a gaming console; it became part of many kids&#8217; sweet childhood 
        memories with famous characters such as Mario. Now those kids have grown to adulthood but still associate themselves with Nintendo&#8217;s legacy and the fandom.
